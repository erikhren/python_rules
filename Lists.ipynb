    "b = a<br>\n",
    "b is a<br>\n",
    "True<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- The association of a variable with an object is called a reference (here, two references to the same object).\n",
    "- An object with more than one reference has more than one name, so we say that the object is aliased.\n",
    "- If the aliased object is mutable, changes made with one alias affect the other:<br>\n",
    "b[0] = 17<br>\n",
    "print(a)<br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "**List Arguments**\n",
    "- When you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference to the list. \n",

    "- The parameter t and the variable letters are ALIASES for the same object.\n",

    "False<br>\n",

    "def bad_delete_head(t):<br>\n",
    "t = t[1:] # WRONG!<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- The slice operator creates a new list and the assignment makes t refer to it, but none of that has any effect on the list that was passed as an argument.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- An alternative is to write a function that creates and returns a new list. <br>\n",
    "- For example, tail returns all but the first element of a list:<br>\n",
