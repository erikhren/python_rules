    "# Tuples \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are a sequence of values (like a list). They can be any type, and they are indexed by integers. The important difference is that tuples are **immutable**. Tuples are also comparable and **hashable** so we can sort lists of them and use tuples as key values \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**HASHABLE (definition):** An object is said to be hashable if it has a hash value that remains the same during its lifetime. ... Objects which are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default; they all compare unequal \n",
    "(except with themselves), and their hash value is derived from their id(). A tuple is basically a comma-separated list of values:<br>\n",
    "t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- NOT necessary, but it is common to enclose tuples in parentheses to help us quickly identify tuples when we look at Python code:<br>\n",
    "t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include the FINAL COMMA:<br>\n",
    "t1 = ('a',)<br>\n",
    "type(t1)<br>\n",
    "<type 'tuple'><br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- OR with built-in function tuple. With no argument, it creates an empty tuple: The word “tuple” comes from the names given to sequences of numbers of varying lengths: single, double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, sextuple, septuple, etc.<br>\n",
    "t = tuple()<br>\n",
    "print(t)<br>\n",
    "()<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- If the argument is a sequence (string, list, or tuple), the result of the call to tuple is a tuple with the elements of the sequence:<br>\n",

    "('l', 'u', 'p', 'i', 'n', 's')<br>\n",

    "- Python compares the first element from each sequence. \n",
    "- If they are equal, it goes on to the next element, and so on, until it finds elements that differ. \n",
    "- When it finds it it stops looking no matter what <br>\n",
    "(0, 1, 2) < (0, 3, 4)<br>\n",

    "- SORT() function works the same way. \n",
    "- It sorts primarily by first element, but in the case of a tie, it sorts by second element, and so on.\n",
    "- This feature is called a DSU pattern \n",
    "- DECORATE a sequence by building a list of tuples with one or more sort keys preceding the elements from the sequence,\n",
    "- SORT the list of tuples using the Python built-in sort, and\n",
    "- UNDECORATE by extracting the sorted elements of the sequence.\n",
    "- For example, suppose you have a list of words and you want to sort them from longest to shortest:\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "- sort compares the first element, length, first, and only considers the second element to break ties.  The keyword argument reverse=True tells sort to go in decreasing order. <br>\n",
    "t.sort(reverse=True) <br>\n",

    "#### 10.3 Tuple assignment**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the unique syntactic features of the Python language is the ability to have a tuple on the left side of an assignment statement. This allows you to assign more than one variable at a time when the left side is a sequence.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- In this example we have a two-element list (which is a sequence) and assign the first and second elements of the sequence to the variables x and y in a single statement.<br>\n",
    "m = [ 'have', 'fun' ]<br>\n",
    "x, y = m<br>\n",
    "x<br>\n",
    "'have'<br>\n",
    "y<br>\n",
    "'fun'<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- It is not magic, Python roughly translates the tuple assignment syntax to be the following:2<br>\n",
    "m = [ 'have', 'fun' ]<br>\n",
    "x = m[0]<br>\n",
    "y = m[1]<br>\n",
    "x<br>\n",
    "'have'<br>\n",
    "y<br>\n",
    "'fun'<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stylistically when we use a tuple on the left side of the assignment statement, we omit the parentheses, but the following is an equally valid syntax:<br>\n",
    "m = [ 'have', 'fun' ]<br>\n",
    "(x, y) = m<br>\n",
    "x<br>\n",
    "'have'<br>\n",
    "y<br>\n",
    "'fun'<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A particularly clever application of tuple assignment allows us to swap the values of two variables in a single statement:<br>\n",
    "a, b = b, a<br>\n",
    "- Python does not translate the syntax literally. For example, if you try this with a dictionary,it will not work as might expect.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.4. DICTIONARIES AND TUPLES\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both sides of this statement are tuples, but the left side is a tuple of variables; the right side is a tuple of expressions. \n",
    "- Each value on the right side is assigned to its respective variable on the left side. \n",
    "- All the expressions on the right side are evaluated before any of the assignments.\n",
    "- The number of variables on the left and the number of values on the right must be the same:<br>\n",
    "a, b = 1, 2, 3<br>\n",
    "ValueError: too many values to unpack<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- More generally, the right side can be any kind of sequence (string, list, or tuple).<br>\n",
    "- For example, to split an email address into a user name and a domain, you could write:<br>\n",
    "addr = 'monty@python.org'<br>\n",
    "uname, domain = addr.split('@')<br>\n",
    "- The return value from split is a list with two elements; the first element is assigned to uname, the second to domain.<br>\n",

    "#### 10.4 Dictionaries and tuples\n",
    "\n",

    "t = list(d.items())<br>\n",
    "print(t)<br>\n",
    "[('b', 1), ('a', 10), ('c', 22)]<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- As you should expect from a dictionary, the items are in no particular order.\n",
    "- However, since the list of tuples is a list, and tuples are comparable, we can now sort the list of tuples.\n",
    "- Converting a dictionary to a list of tuples is a way for us to output the contents of a dictionary sorted by key:<br>\n",
    "d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}<br>\n",
    "t = list(d.items())<br>\n",

    "t.sort()<br>\n",
    "t<br>\n",
    "[('a', 10), ('b', 1), ('c', 22)]<br>\n",
    "- The new list is sorted in ascending alphabetical order by the key value.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10.5 Multiple assignment with dictionaries \n",
    "\n",
    "- Combining items, tuple assignment, and for, you can see a nice code pattern for traversing the keys and values of a dictionary in a single loop:<br>\n",
    "for key, val in list(d.items()):<br>\n",
    "print(val, key)<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- This loop has two iteration variables because items returns a list of tuples and key, val is a tuple assignment that successively iterates through each of the key-value pairs in the dictionary.\n",
    "- For each iteration through the loop, both key and value are advanced to the next key-value pair in the dictionary (still in hash order). The output of this loop is:\n",
    "10 a<br>\n",
    "22 c<br>\n",
    "1 b<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- Again, it is in hash key order (i.e., no particular order).\n",
    "- If we combine these two techniques, we can print out the contents of a dictionary sorted by the value stored in each key-value pair.\n",
    "- To do this, we first make a list of tuples where each tuple is (value, key). \n",
    "- The items method would give us a list of (key, value) tuples, but this time we want to sort by value, not key. \n",
    "- Once we have constructed the list with the value-key tuples, it is a simple matter to sort the list in reverse order and print out the new, sorted list.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}<br>\n",
    "l = list()<br>\n",
